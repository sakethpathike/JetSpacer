# JetSpacer

JetSpacer is an android client that merges multiple space-related APIs including NASA's APOD and Mars Rover's API into a single, simple application with a good UI.

- As this project is meant as a "client," you can change API keys within the app.

## Tech Stack

- Kotlin - The app is completely written in Kotlin
- Jetpack Compose - Jetpack Compose is used to write the UI, making it a completely Jetpack Compose-based project
- Material 3 - Used for building the UI with existing components provided by the library
- Ktor-client - Used to make HTTP requests to the respective APIs
- Room - Used for local database
- Kotlin Coroutines - Used for managing background tasks
- Kotlin Flows - Used for handling asynchronous data streams
- Kotlinx Serialization - Used for deserializing API responses.
- Coil - Used for loading images and Architecture Components such as DataStore, Navigation, ViewModel are also used to make this app alive!

- #### "JetSpacer" uses the MVVM architecture concept to keep code organised and separate business logic from the UI.
